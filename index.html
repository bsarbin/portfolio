  		<h1>How I work</h1>
      <p>I love being at the forefront of product design, innovating through simplification. One of my favorite parts is taking complex and messy systems and simplifying them into solutions that solve people's needs. It's always a humbling experience when you hear executives pitching the story I told them, or watching product teams continue to innovate on the work I started.</p>
      <p>I set goals and expectations early. Goals are my compass along each phase of the design process, and I've found them invaluable to mitigating risks and helping to explain my design decisions to stakeholders.</p>
      <p>I love constraints. Constraints have been the catalyst for some of my best work and have enabled me to design under extremely tight deadlines. When I work with teams who lack focus or constraints, I will create my own, even if they're wrong, and use them to generate concrete wirefames which helps the team figure out how the project should evolve.</p>
      <p>I design for efficiency. My goal is to do as much thinking on behalf of the user as possible, so they don't have to. I provide enough detail to make decisions (or show where to go next), I provide contextual recommendations based on expert best practices, and I design workflows to be completed fast and without mistakes.</p>
      <p>I explain my design rational with development. It empowers them to stay make good decisions on behalf of the user when developing all the small details, and it allows me to focus on the more challenging design problems. I've also found my ability to jump into code to finalize visuals and animations during crunch time builds developer street credit, and allows them focus on challenging technical problems.</p>
      <p>I design for simplicity. My approach along all phases is to keep removing one thing at a time until it no longer makes sense, and then add the last piece back. I simplify technical, bottom-up approaches by providing a top-down, business-centric approach.</p>
      <p>I research along the way. All of my designs have been improved by understanding the competition and constantly listening to stakeholder, developer and end-user feedback. My goal is to translate what they say into what end-users are ultimately trying to accomplish.</p>
