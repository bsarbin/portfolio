  		<h1>How I work</h1>
      <p>I love a good challenge. One of the reasons I've enjoyed the Enterprise space is that I enjoy taking incredibly complex and messy workflows and simplifying them to a more consumer experience. That's not to say the tools are easy or no longer technical. I find ways to make the process easy to understand and I help users interact with business objects instead of low-level details.</p>
      <p>I love constraints. I find project constraints one of the most powerful tools in my toolbox. </p>
  		<p>Goal setting and expectations. Whether it's a 3 week sprint to generate a thought-leadership story or a multi-month haul to create a new feature,  I like to define the goals, criteria for success and timeline with the stakeholders. I can't stress how important this part is to me. I'll work with the stakeholders to define the project boundaries or create my own to share with the team and create buy-in.</p>
      <p></p>
      <p>I  consider my initial wireframes as a concrete version of defining the goals. </p>
      <p>I remove bit-by-bit until it no longer makes sense, and then add the last bit back. </p>
      <p>Industry and technology research. Usability and feedback research. In place of actual users, I'll watch how well the subject matter experts understand the concepts and the developers. I take their feedback with a grain of salt, but if these guys, who can think really abstractly and design complex technical systems, don't get it, things don't look good for end-users.</p>
      <p>I explain my design intent and thought process to subject matter experts and the developers. It empowers developers to fill in the smaller details while being true to the design, they can work more independetly, and I've received amazing ideas more than once from these guys.</p>
      <p>I think it's incredible how quickly users find a shortcut or find the easy way out. I like to pull data in to provide a complete picture of what to do. Provide recommendations based on what experts think. The end result is users can focus on their task and let the UI and workflows take care of what they need.</p>
      <p>Simplicity is beautiful. </p>

      List out why I think these projects are noteworthy. Why should interviewers click on these to learn more? They certainly won't know the product name. Maybe include a short phrase instead that highlights important aspects of the project, specifically from my design skill perspective. Make it oriented around a case study.
