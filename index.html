  		<h1>How I work</h1>
      <p>I find project constraints one of the most powerful tools in my toolbox. </p>
  		<p>I  At the start of every project, I like to define the goals, criteria for success and timeline with the stakeholders. I can't stress how important this part is to me. I'll work with the stakeholders to define the project boundaries or create my own to share with the team and create buy-in.</p>
      <p></p>
      <p>I  consider my initial wireframes as a concrete version of defining the goals. </p>
      <p>I remove bit-by-bit until it no longer makes sense, and then add the last bit back. </p>
      <p>Industry and technology research. Usability and feedback research. In place of actual users, I'll watch how well the subject matter experts understand the concepts and the developers. I take their feedback with a grain of salt, but if these guys, who can think really abstractly and design complex technical systems, don't get it, things don't look good for end-users.</p>
