<h2>Mobile Network Management</h2>

<p class="description">The Mobile Network Management project was my first deep-dive into product design. At the start of the project, the phrase "mobile first" was just beginning to be coined and the iPad wasn't released. Needless to say, most Enterprise product managers couldn't imagine that their customers would want to do any part of their job on a phone. So, another designer and I set out to identify if there was an opportunity for a mobile network management app. We began by running a survey at a Cisco Live event to investigate what part of customer jobs took place away from the desk. As it turns out, many IT managers were on call 24/7 and when a network hiccup occured, they would have to drop what they were doing to come in to fix the problem, but there were also a lot of false-positives which couldn't be determined because the data was on their work computer. We used this data to build a prototype that enabled customers to have insights into network issues and validate isses on their phone. We also spent a lot of time on designing the notifications to be informative but not intrusive because these guys could easily receive 200 issues in a day if things were going arwy.</p>

<p class="result">With our mobile prototype, we were able to convince leadership that there was a need for a mobile application. They set aside budget and development resources, and we spent the next few months developing and launching the app on the Apple and Android App stores.</p>
