	<p class="description first">CloudVPN was a heck of a lot of work in a short amount of time. The CloudVPN project began as a new initiative to sell traditional, complicated products as simple services. The goal was to enable small to medium businesses to order network security from a service provider easily and without any special training. However, we only had four months to ship the product. When I joined, I quickly went to work to establish a clear product direction that distilled networking to it's core values delivered to businesses. My designs presented users with a simple ordering flow that gathered input about their business and their needs. Once a user submitted their order, the powerful backend would work it's magic, and all the user saw was their services lighting up on a map--it was that simple. Along this accelerated timeline I was able to stymie feature creep and complexity by convincing engineering to move advanced configuration to a service provider portal and by advocating for automation at every step of the process. I also worked hard to ensured that the designs were modern, yet implementable by engineering.</p>

	<p class="result">In the end, we successfully delivered a working product at the end of the four months! Our client was extremely happy with how the project had turned out and how we had incorporated their marketing needs along the way. Consumers of the portal loved how easy we had made networking and couldn't wait to get their hands on the product.</p>
