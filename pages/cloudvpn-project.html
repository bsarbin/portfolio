	<p class="description">CloudVPN was a heck of a lot of work in a short amount of time. The CloudVPN project began as a new type of product to allow small to medium businesses IT manager to order network security from a managed service provider. However, we only had four months to ship the product and we only had the technology backend. When I joined, quickly went to work to establish a clear design direction that distilled networking to it's core values delivered to businesses. My designs presented users with a simple ordering flow that gathered input about their business and their needs. Once a user submitted their order, the powerful backend would work it's magic, and all the user saw was a map showing the service being delivered--it was that simple. Along this accelerated timeline I hid complexity by offloading the "hard networking work" to the managed provider portal and I advocated for automating as much of the network fulfillment process as possible. I also ensured that the designs were modern, but also implementable by engineering.</p>

	<p class="result">In the end, we successfully delivered a working product at the end of the four months! Our client was extremely happy with how the project had turned out and how we had incorporated their marketing needs along the way. Consumers of the portal loved how easy we had made networking and couldn't wait to get their hands on the product.</p>

Instead of users guessing how to configure their services, the profile provides contextual recommendations based on your company's needs.</figure></div>
