	<p class="description">Consumers are bringing more devices into the living-room and using them while they watch TV. This project illustrates how our Service Provider customers can capitalize on this trend by pairing an iPad directly with the content on the TV. In this experience, the TV is used to do what it does best, display content. The iPad took the content and showed the chapters as visual blocks which they could tap on to jump to that part of the game, kind of like a big visual DVR remote. Once consumers find a sport they enjoyed watching, the iPad stays in-sync with the video showing contextual information such as the bio of the current, on-screen athlete. The experience also highlighted new ways to monetize TV programming by including actionable, contextual ads on the iPad and interactive advertising. Now, when you see your favorite new movie trailer, you can order tickets right there for opening weekend!</p>

	<p class="result">This project was shown at the 2012 London Olympics to customers and it helped to spark future projects with Cisco. Because it was built to be live, part of my design constraints was to build a template so that content could be published daily to the app. When the games were over, I brought in users to test the experience (with a fancy camera setup to capture the TV, facial expressions and iPad screen), they all loved the application and wished they had it when the games had been live. Maybe we will for the next games!</p>

The chapters are displayed as videos and it lets users navigate around recorded content with ease--"it's like a visual DVR".</figure></div>
