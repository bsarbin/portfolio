	<p class="description first">Consumers are bringing more devices into the living-room and using them while they watch TV. This project explored how our Service Providers and Content Providers can capitalize on this trend by pairing an iPad directly with the content on the TV. In this experience, the TV is used to do what it does best, display content, while the iPad acts as a giant remote control. The iPad displayed the chapters of the Olympics as visual blocks which users could tap on to immediately navigate to that part of the video, kind of like a big visual DVR remote. Once consumers find a sport they enjoyed watching, the iPad stays in-sync with the video and shows contextual data such as the bio of the athelete on screen or the results of the last race. The experience also highlighted new ways to monetize TV programming by including contextual banner ads on the iPad and interactive advertising based on the commercial playing on TV. Now, when you see your favorite new movie trailer, you can order tickets right there for opening weekend!</p>

	<p class="result">This project was shown at the 2012 London Olympics to customers and it helped to spark future projects with Cisco. Because it was built to be live, part of my design constraints was to build a template so that content could be published daily to the app. When the games were over, I brought in users to test the experience (with a fancy camera setup to capture the TV, facial expressions and iPad screen). Consumers loved the application and wished they had it when the games had been live. Maybe we will for the next games!</p>

The chapters are displayed as videos and it lets users navigate around recorded content with ease--"it's like a visual DVR".</figure></div>
