	<p class ="project-type">Innovative Design Prototype to Product</p>
	<p class="design-challenge">Improve upon my previous work on CloudVPN to account for scalability and flexibility.</p>
	<div class="value-props">
		<div>Service templates make configuring 1,000 sites is about as easy as configuring 1 site.</div>
		<div>In-app guidance and default settings makes it networking easy.</div>

	<p class="description first">A lot of the design decisions made in <span class="cloudvpn-project">CloudVPN</span> for small businesses just wouldn't make sense for large Enterprise networks consisting of 10,000 sites. The first thing I did when I started working on vBranch was determine the constraints in order to help simplify. As it turns out most customers who want to use vBranch want to run the same services at each their office sites with very little, if any variation. This constraint led me to design a service template which contained all of the services and devices required for a site. Service templates make scalability trivial. If a company is expanding into 20 new engineering buildes, all the networking team needs to do is enter the build addresses, select the "Engineering" template and click submit; and that's it, he's done.</p>

	<p class="description">During the course of the project I also added in some really cool features to help filter and sort large volumes of data. I am also really excited with the power user tools to help users lasso-select multiple sites in a map view--it's not a feature for everyone, but for those users who need it, they love it. One thing that makes this project particularly exciting to me is that I have been able to iterate and simplify navigation and conceptual issues based on a refined understanding of customer needs through multiple review sessions. I've been able to carry the design to completion, even solving issues others said were insurmoutable.</p>

	<p class="result">All of the hardwork I've put in to vBranch has paid off. The UI I have designed has been central to almost every customer conversation because it explains the power of the solution in a straightforward manner--customers immediately see the value. The work has also convinced executives that vBranch will be one of the next big products, and so funding has come in and teams are ramping up now to productize the solution.</p>

Here we can see a user ordering a new site. The innovation here is having the user select which service they want in step 2 and those services drive hardware requirements in step 4.</figure></div>
