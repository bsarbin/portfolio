<h2>vBranch</h2>

<p class="description">The vBranch project is similar to the CloudVPN project in that users deploy network services, but customers of vBranch wanted to deploy to much large networks than CloudVPN. A lot of the design decisions made in CloudVPN for small businesses just wouldn't make sense for large Enterprise networks consisting of 10,000 sites. When I got down to designing vBranch, I began by defining a few key goals that would guide the rest of my work: design around business services, enable efficient service deployment and keep the simplicity of CloudVPN. To handle the complexity of these large networks, I introduced service templates which contained the set of services users wanted at each branch site named after organizational functions.  Now, if a company was needed a new engineering office, all the IT manager needed to do was add the "Engineering Template" to the site, select the hardware based on his service requirements and then wait about 5 mintues for the service to come online (a 5 minute wait time is a 2,000x increase in efficiency compared to traditional branch technology, just sayin'). From those intial concepts, I have been fortunate enough to work through multiple design iterations; each time driving innovation and simplicity to improve the product based on feedback from customers, key stakeholders and development.</p>

<p class="result">vBranch has become a very hot topic in the networking industry and customers are lining up to start using it. Cisco is in a really good place to compete in this market because the internal leadership kept investing in the project because they were able to visualize how vBranch solved customer problems, due in large part to how easy my designs were to understand and use. I'm really excited, and humbled, to have this product launch soon.</p>
