	<p class ="project-type">Innovative Design Prototype to Product</p>
	<p class="design-challenge">Improve upon my previous work on CloudVPN to account for scalability and flexibility.</p>

	<p class="description first">A lot of the design decisions made in <span class="cloudvpn-project">CloudVPN</span> for small businesses didn't make sense for large Enterprise networks consisting of 10,000 sites. After some initial user research, I learned an important clue to help simplify the complexity of managing 10,000 objects. Most customers who want to use vBranch want to run identical services at each their office sites with very little, if any variation. This constraint led me to design a service template which contains all of the services and devices required for a site. Service templates make scalability trivial. If a company is expanding into 20 new engineering builds, all the networking team needs to do is enter the build addresses, select the "Engineering" template and click submit; and that's it, he's done.</p>

	<p class="description">During the course of the project I also added in some really cool features to help filter and sort large volumes of data. I am also really excited with the power user, multi-select tools such as lasso to select multiple sites on a map--it's not a feature for the infrequent usr, but for those users who use it every day, they love it. One thing that makes this project particularly exciting to me is that I have been able to iterate and simplify navigation and conceptual issues based on a refined understanding of customer needs through multiple review sessions. I've been able to carry the design to completion, even solving issues others said were insurmountable.</p>

	<p class="result">All of the hard work I've put in to vBranch has paid off. The UI I have designed has been central to almost every customer conversation because it explains the power of the solution in a straightforward manner--customers immediately see the value. The work has also convinced executives that vBranch will be one of the next big products, and so funding has come in and teams are ramping up now to productize the solution.</p>

An early concept exploring dense data visualizations and a cascading, top-down master-details view. I moved away from this navigation because it wasn't scaling well past 100 sites and data was often duplicated in different locations.</figure></div>
	<div class="screenshot"><img src="resources/projects/vbranch-project/vbranch-03.gif" /><figure>Fig 4. One innovate feature in these designs is the in-app purchases enabled with the add site flow. Here we can see a user ordering a new site. The innovation here is having the user select which service they want in step 2 and those services drive hardware requirements in step 4.</figure></div>
