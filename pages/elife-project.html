	<p class="description first">The Entertainment Lifestyle project (eLife for short) explored a new way to watch television; one that brought the lean-back experience of the TV, but also enabled more ad hoc viewing, similar to exploring YouTube. When users first launch eLife, they are presented with a customized list of "channels" that include traditional TV channels, personalized channels and channels curated and shared by your friends. Drilling into a personalized "channels" reveals a list of videos curated by either people or machines studying viewing habits. The coolest part of the "channel" concept is that it's made up of content from a variety of premium sources: Netflix, Hulu, Vimeo, DVR, Pay-per-view and of course Live TV. These videos are presented in a single content stream, seamlessly stitching together videos in an endless stream that mimmicks live TV. Of course, users can easily use their finger on an iPad or iPhone to navigate forwards or backwards in time and jump right to the content they want to watch now. Discovering more about an actor or binge watching a new TV show was as easy as swipe and tap. The designs also include elements of monetization such as personalized advertizing and the ability to up-sell premium content that users could impluse purchase on the spot.</p>

	<p class="result">eLife provided Cisco Service Provider customers with strategic insights into how they could use their premium content deals as a competitive advantage against the growing Over The Top (OTT) providers such as Netflix or Amazon. eLife was also used to negotiate technology deals with Cisco's customers.</p>
