	<p class="description">The Entertainment Lifestyle project (eLife for short) explored a new way to watch television; one that brought the lean-back experience of the TV, but also include the non-linear, binge-watching from the web. When users first launch eLife, they are presented with a customized list of "channels" that include feature recommended content and shared social channels. Drilling into a "channel" reveals a list of TV videos curated by people or by machines studying your viewing habits. The coolest part of the "channel" is that it's made up of content from all your subscribed sources: Netflix, Hulu, Vimeo, DVR, Pay-per-view and of course Live TV. Having all of the content in one place that auto-played solved multiple problems at once. It solved the problem of what to watch tonight across content silos. It enabled actionable advertising. Best of all, consumers could lean-back and zone out while their favorite shows like traditional TV or they could jump around to what's hot like they do on the web.</p>

	<p class="result">Service Providers definitely enjoyed the eLife app because it showed them how they could continue to monetize their video cash-cow. It also provided them with strategic insights into how they could use their premium content deals as a competitive advantage against the growing Over The Top (OTT) providers such as Netflix or Amazon.</p>
