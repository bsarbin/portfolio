<h2>Codename: IWAN, IVPN</h2>
<p class="description">These two projects were two of my favorites because of the difficulty of the design challenge. The team approached me after seeing the vBranch designs because they needed help simplifying the new IWAN solution. The IWAN team had built a really powerful VPN technology that was unfortutely incredibly complicated to configure; even the lead experts said they would have issues setting up and customizing the solution. However, the team was focused on simplifying the solution because we all believed the simplier it was, the more users would want it and the more we could sell. My solution was to build a UI where users could select and directly manipulte the network, or rather, an approximation of the network.</p> 

<p class="description">My inspration for this design came while reviewing my notes after the knowledge transfer sessions. I noticed that every time one of the experts needed to explain the technology they immediately started drawing network diagrams and jotting down notes on how the user should configure each section. It got me thinking, "if these guys need diagrams to explain the technology, why can't we build a UI that does the same and allows them to configure along the way". I began to split the configuration into logical, configurable components. Once I had a handle on the objects the user needed to configure, I mocked-up the zoom and pan animations in Keynote to explain the concept to stakeholders. The team was blown away. IWAN was now easy to configure because users would just select the part of the network they wanted to configure, zoom in, and relevant controls were shown. After the stakeholder meetings, I continued to work with the technology experts to reduce the number of inputs we required from the user, and to remove the remaining nerdy inputs. I was able to remove the most detailed questions by instead gathering inputs about what the user was trying to accomplish and then use those to either configure the network for the user or to provide a recommendation on how the user should configure based on their needs. Based on user feedback, users love how simple IWAN is and that lead to reusing the same design pattern to configure the IVPN technology.</p>
