	<h2>IWAN & IVPN</h2>

	<p class ="project-type">Innovative Design Prototype to Product</p>
	<p class="design-challenge">Simplify a super complex, detailed technology so that users can configure it quickly, without training or mistakes.</p>
	<div class="value-props">
		<div>Customers can configure networks without needing to invest in expensive training.</div>
		<div>A simple ordering flow leads to more sales.</div>
		<div>Fewer mistakes. A more secure network. Happier bosses.</div>
	</div>

	<p class="description first">These two projects were both based around a similar design challenge--how to make a really complex, detailed technology and make it simple for a network engineer to configure who doesn't know the details of the technology. The twist? The technologists who built it said they would had difficulties remembering all the details.</p>

	<p class="description">During the knowledge transfer meeting for IWAN, I noticed the technology experts always went to the whiteboard to explain networking concepts. This sort of direct manipulation inspired me to design a zoom-ui where users are presented with an overview of their network where they can click on a region and zoom in to configure that part of the network. During this engagement, I also pushed to remove the nerdy, detailed inputs and to simplify the experience by guiding users with best practice recommendations, defaulting common settings or by asking business-centric questions to recommend features based on the customer requirements.</p>

	<p class="result">User and stakeholder feedback has been exceptionally positive. A network engineer who does not know about IWAN can configure the service in less than 15 minutes, which is impressive when you compare it to the official hour-long IWAN training courses. Stakeholders were so impressed, that they asked for similar designs when it was time to start selling IVPN.</p>

Organizing and presenting configuration visually, in-context makes it immediately obvious what the user needs to configure. Traditionally this configuration would be a line of text in a large text file or a drop-down in a page full of inputs.</figure></div>
