<h2>IWAN & IVPN</h2>
<p class="description">These two projects were based around a similar design challenge--how to make a really complex, detailed technology and make it simple for a network engineer to configure who doesn't know the details of the technology. The twist? The technologists who built it said they would had difficulties remembering what all the variables did.</p>

<p class="description">During the knowledge transfer meeting for IWAN, I noticed the technology experts always went to the whiteboard to explain networking concepts and to doodled network configuration near different parts of the network. This sort of direct manipulation inspired me to design a zoom-ui where users are presented with an overview of their network and then zoom in to each section for configuration specific to that part of the network. I also pushed the technology experts to remove any nerdy, detailed inputs through best practices, default settings, auto-generated values or by asking business-centric questions to recommend features based on the customer profile.</p>

<p class="result">User and stakeholder feedback has been exceptionally positive. A network engineer who does not know about IWAN can configure the service in less than 15 minutes, which is impressive because IWAN training courses are an hour long. Stakeholders were so impressed, that they asked for similar designs when it was time to start selling IVPN.</p>
