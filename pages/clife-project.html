	<p class="description first">At the start of this project, Cisco was starting a new marketing campaign called the Internet of Everything campaign describing how people, data and machines will become interconnected. Customers were getting excited about the message, but didn't know how to take advantage of the new use cases. Our team was tasked to show the value of the Internet of Everything. I spent time with other designers iterating through different home use cases such as home security, connected pantries and connected gardens. Eventually we discovered that customers wanted to see lots of examples of how to apply the technology. We crafted a futuristic, day-in-the-life story of a boy inviting his friend home from school and how technology improved his family's quality of life. We told the story using a technology called Project Mapping, where we use projectors to project onto different objects, transforming the space around an audience into a life-sized, 3D(ish) story.</p>

	<p class="result">The Connected Life was shown at CES, IBC and has been installed in the largest Cisco Executive Briefing Center in San Jose. The final design product has hit a sweet-spot with customers. The business-centered story told through the immersive demo helped them imagine how they could market connected devices to consumers, and it proved that Cisco was the technology partner they should continue to partner with. In addition to our innovation awards, we were also had 3rd-party event organizers fund our demo at additional trade shows. Cisco customers also wanted to capitalize on our innovative ideas such as our <a target="_blank" href="https://priorart.ip.com/IPCOM/000239649">No-UI, point-to-select interactions</a>.</p>
