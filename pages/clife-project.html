	<p class="description first">At the start of this project, Cisco was starting a new marketing campaign called the Internet of Everything, describing how people, data and machines will become interconnected. Customers were getting excited about the message, but didn't know how to apply the the new technologies to their business. Our team was tasked to show specific examples of how customers could take advantage of the Internet of Everything. I spent time with other designers iterating through different home use cases such as home security, connected pantries and connected gardens. We crafted a futuristic, day-in-the-life story of a boy, Aiden, inviting his friend home from school and how technology improved his family's quality of life. We transport the audience into these life-sized scenes using a medium called projection mapping; which uses projectors with specially designed videos to transform two blank walls and generic objects into these immersive sets.</p>

	<p class="result">The final design product has hit a sweet-spot with customers and won several awards at CES and IBC. The business-centered story told through the immersive demo helped them imagine how they could market connected services to consumers, and it proved that Cisco was the best technology partner. Cisco customers also wanted to capitalize on our innovative ideas such as our <a target="_blank" href="https://priorart.ip.com/IPCOM/000239649">No-UI, point-to-select interactions</a>.</p>
