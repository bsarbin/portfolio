	<p class="description">The Oban project is one of my oldest, but the impact of these business-centric designs have helped to shape how a company like Cisco can stay relevant during the transition to virtual. With this project, I presented a simpler way to order and consume network services. Before this point, setting up networks was very time consuming and required highly skilled, expensive staff or contractors. Instead of designing a bottom-up application like everyone else, I presented a simplifier solution where a managed providers could sell network services to businesses. I showed how all of the complicated configuration could be handled by the managed provider and therefore simplify what the customer needed to know in order to get high quality network services. The workflows spanned a customer and a managed provider tablet application. The managed provider could use the tablet to go on the customer's site and gather customer requirements and use the mobile capabilities to measure the campus environment for optimal WiFi placement. Once the service order was fulfilled, customers could log into their own application which gave a simple overview giving them just enough details to know if their service was being delivered as expected.</p>

	<p class="result">The thought leadership shown in this project helped my team win executive support to be the lead design group to design the next generation of Cisco's portfolio including <span class="cloudvpn-project">CloudVPN</span>, <span class="vbranch-project">vBranch</span> and <span class="iwan-ivpn-project">IWAN configuration</span>.</p>

The new estimate screen presents network services as business objects is the most innovative idea in Oban. The traditional way to think about services was a weird mix of devices, configuration and device and pseudo-business logic. If the last sentence sounds confusing, that's because things were that bad (if not worse). That's why this idea was so important to simplify customer networks.</figure></div>
